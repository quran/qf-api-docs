This differentiates them from [content APIs](/docs/category/content-apis) that focus on non-user-specific resources like translations, tafsirs, and verses.\n\n ## How to get access \n\n We are using OAuth2 flows to authenticate and authorize requests. To get started, you need to [get an access token](docs/tutorials/oidc/getting-started-with-oauth2#obtaining-oauth-20-client-credentials) to make requests to our APIs. Then follow the steps mentioned [here](/docs/tutorials/oidc/getting-started-with-oauth2). \n\n ## Pagination \n\n We are using cursor based pagination. The pagination query params consist of `first`,`after`, `before` and `last`. \n\n Example \n - `first: 10` will give you first 10 items \n - `first: 10, after: xyz` will give you first 10 items after the item with id `xyz` \n - `last: 10` will give you the last 10 items \n - `last: 10, before: xyz` will give you the last 10 items before the item with id `xyz` \n\n The only possible combinations are `first + after` or `last + before`. They should not be used together"},"postman":{"name":"Get posts","description":{"content":"Get list of posts.","type":"text/plain"},"url":{"path":["v1","posts",""],"host":["{{baseUrl}}"],"query":[{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"Get posts of an exact Ayah only and not of range of Ayahs (the default behavior).","type":"text/plain"},"key":"exactAyah","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"Comma-separated language iso codes, to fetch posts in a specific language(s).","type":"text/plain"},"key":"languages","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"Include posts of scholars","type":"text/plain"},"key":"scholarsPosts","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"The Ids of the authors of the posts","type":"text/plain"},"key":"authorIds","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"Include posts of students of knowledge","type":"text/plain"},"key":"studentsOfKnowledgePosts","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"Include verified posts","type":"text/plain"},"key":"verified","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"Include approved posts","type":"text/plain"},"key":"approved","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"Get posts that are updated after the given date (inclusive).","type":"text/plain"},"key":"updatedSince","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"Further customize the results, you can fetch posts of specific members, post that have specific tags, post for specific surah, ayah range or single ayah etc.","type":"text/plain"},"key":"filters","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"**`newest`** = Recent posts will be at the top. \n\n  **`following`** = Get posts of authors the current user is following. \n\n  **`draft`** = Get current user's private posts. \n\n  **`favorite`** = Get current user's favorite posts. \n\n  **`most_popular`** = Get most popular posts. \n\n  **`only_room_members`** = Get posts that are posted by current room members. \n\n  **`public`** = Include public posts of private rooms. \n\n  **`feed`** = When passed, this will ignore most passed filters and send `verified` posts (if `verified` = `true`), posts by scholars and student of knowledge, verified posts, posts from author the user is following.","type":"text/plain"},"key":"tab","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"Include only trusted posts and posts by author the user is following.","type":"text/plain"},"key":"feed","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"The current post page.
