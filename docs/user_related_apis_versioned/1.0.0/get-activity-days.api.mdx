This differentiates them from [content APIs](/docs/category/content-apis) that focus on non-user-specific resources like translations, tafsirs, and verses.\n\n ## How to get access \n\n We are using OAuth2 flows to authenticate and authorize requests. To get started, you need to [get an access token](/docs/tutorials/oidc/getting-started-with-oauth2#obtaining-oauth-20-client-credentials) to make requests to our APIs. Then follow the steps mentioned [here](/docs/tutorials/oidc/getting-started-with-oauth2). \n\n ## Pagination \n\n We are using cursor based pagination. The pagination query params consist of `first`,`after`, `before` and `last`. \n\n Example \n - `first: 10` will give you first 10 items \n - `first: 10, after: xyz` will give you first 10 items after the item with id `xyz` \n - `last: 10` will give you the last 10 items \n - `last: 10, before: xyz` will give you the last 10 items before the item with id `xyz` \n\n The only possible combinations are `first + after` or `last + before`. They should not be used together"},"postman":{"name":"Get activity days","description":{"content":"Get user activity days.","type":"text/plain"},"url":{"path":["v1","activity-days",""],"host":["{{baseUrl}}"],"query":[{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"The start date of the activity days","type":"text/plain"},"key":"from","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"The last date of the activity days","type":"text/plain"},"key":"to","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"Order by activity day's date","type":"text/plain"},"key":"dateOrderBy","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"The type of the activity day","type":"text/plain"},"key":"type","value":""},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"The number of items to be fetched.
