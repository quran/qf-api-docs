# OAuth2 Scopes

Quran.Foundations's OAuth 2.0 scopes provide a way to limit the amount of access that is granted to
an access token. When requesting an accessing token, clients should also request the scopes they are
interested in getting access to. If the APIs are user-related, the user will need to consent to
granting access to the scopes your app is requesting first.
