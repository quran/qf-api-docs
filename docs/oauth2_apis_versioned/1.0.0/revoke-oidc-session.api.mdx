This endpoint handles the user logout process in Quran.Foundation's OAuth2 & OpenID Connect system. When called, it:

1. Ends the user's current session
2. Revokes associated access and refresh tokens

To redirect users back to your app after logout, include `post_logout_redirect_uri`. The redirect URI must be pre-registered in your OAuth2 client configuration. Post-logout redirect: If you pass `post_logout_redirect_uri`, you must also include `id_token_hint` (the ID token from the login response). Requests with `post_logout_redirect_uri` but without `id_token_hint` will be rejected.
