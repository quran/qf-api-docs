To get started, you need to [get an access token](/docs/tutorials/oidc/getting-started-with-oauth2#obtaining-oauth-20-client-credentials) to make requests to our APIs. Since the APIs are not user-related, you will need to use the `client_credentials` grant type and [`content` scope](/docs/user_related_apis_versioned/scopes#content) when sending a request to [The OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint](/docs/oauth2_apis_versioned/oauth-2-token-exchange) to get the access token. The below diagram shows the flow of getting an access token using the `client_credentials` grant type in a very simplified way.\n\n ![Client Credentials Flow](/img/client-credentials-flow.png) After getting a valid access token, each request to get resources will have to include 2 headers mentioned below: `x-auth-token` and `x-client-id`.","version":"v4"},"postman":{"name":"List reciters","description":{"content":"Returns metadata for all supported audio reciters (qaris), including style and available resources.","type":"text/plain"},"url":{"path":["audio","qaris"],"host":["{{baseUrl}}"],"query":[],"variable":[]},"method":"GET"}}
