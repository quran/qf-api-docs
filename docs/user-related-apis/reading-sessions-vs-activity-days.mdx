title: Reading Sessions vs Activity Days
description: How to choose between Reading Sessions and Activity Days when a user reads.
---

Both are updated when a user reads, but they serve different product use cases.

## Reading Sessions

Tracks the user's most recent reading location (`chapterNumber` + `verseNumber`) for "Continue reading" and "Recently read" UX.

- POST `/v1/reading-sessions` creates a new session unless the latest session was updated within the last 20 minutes, in which case it updates the latest session.
- GET `/v1/reading-sessions` returns the user's reading session history (most recent first).

## Activity Days

Tracks daily activity/progress (by date + type). This powers streaks, goals, and calendar-style progress views.

- POST `/v1/activity-days` creates/updates one activity day per date per type. For `type=QURAN`, it accepts `seconds`, `ranges`, and `mushafId` (and optional `date` for backfill) and enqueues progress updates.
- GET `/v1/activity-days` fetches activity days for a date range (calendar/history).
- GET `/v1/activity-days/estimate-reading-time` estimates seconds from verse ranges.

## When A User Reads (Qur'an)

- Use **Reading Sessions** to save the user's current position for resume/recently-read UX (Surah/Ayah location).
- Use **Activity Days** to credit time/ranges toward streaks, goals, and activity calendar progress.
