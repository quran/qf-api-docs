# OpenID Connect

Quran.Foundation's OAuth 2.0 APIs can be used for both authentication and authorization.

In this [guide](/docs/tutorials/oidc/getting-started-with-oauth2), we have breifly explained what OAuth2 is and how to integrate with Quran.Foundation's OAuth2 server.

Besides OAuth2, Quran.Foundation also supports [OpenId Connect](https://openid.net/connect) standards by providing the [UserInfo Endpoint](/docs/oauth2_apis_versioned/get-oidc-user-info) to get more information about the user.

To be able to access OpenId Connect's endpoints, make sure to include `openid` in the list of requested [scopes](/docs/user_related_apis_versioned/scopes). Once this is done, besides `access_token`, the authorization callback will also contain a [JWT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519) `id_token` parameter.

The [ID Token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken) (`id_token`) contains information about the user and can be decoded using one of the JWT [libraries](https://jwt.io/libraries) to know more about the identity of the user. Below is an example of a decoded `id_token`:
