## OAuth2 Clients

There are a few client SDKs out there for an iOS native app to authenticate and authorize end-users using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. One of the most recommended ones is [AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS). Below is a demo of an AppAuth client that was used to connect to Quran.Foundation Authorization server and authenticate a user.
