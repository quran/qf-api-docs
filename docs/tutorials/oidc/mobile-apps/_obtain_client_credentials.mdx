## Obtaining OAuth 2.0 client credentials

> A perquisite to creating client credentials is for your app to have the value of the redirect URL where the user will land after successfully authenticating/logging out implemented.

Once you have the redirect URL, please contact [us](mailto:osama@quran.com) with the following:

1. Redirect URL.
2. The [scopes](/docs/user_related_apis_versioned/scopes) you would like to be granted to your app.
3. Make sure to mention that it's meant for usage on mobile apps so we enable [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/) support.
