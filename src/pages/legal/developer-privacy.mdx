# Developer Privacy Policy Packet

## Important Notice for Developers

For informational purposes only, below, we provide **GUIDELINES** for a Developer Privacy Policy, a **CHECKLIST**, and a **TEMPLATE** of a Privacy Policy that are intended as a reference to help you meet the minimum requirements for approval on the Quran Foundation platform.

You, as the developer, have unique knowledge of your application, its features, the specific data it collects, and its target audience. Therefore, **you are solely responsible** for ensuring your privacy policy is accurate, comprehensive, and fully compliant with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in every jurisdiction where your app is available.

> **Important:**  
> THE GUIDELINES, CHECKLIST, and TEMPLATE ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS AND DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. THE QURAN FOUNDATION DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ISSUES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON THESE MATERIALS.

We strongly recommend that you consult with **qualified legal counsel** to ensure your final privacy policy is appropriate for your specific circumstances.

## Guidelines for Developer Privacy Policy (Quran Foundation)

These guidelines describe the minimum expectations for any app that uses Quran Foundation (“QF”) APIs and seeks approval on the Quran Foundation platform.

### 1. Introduction and Scope of Policy

The developer’s privacy policy must clearly define its purpose and applicability.

**A. Identification**

State the full name of the application and explicitly mention that it uses the **Quran Foundation APIs**.

**B. Ecosystem Context**

Reference the **Quran.com** domain and **QuranReflect** to situate the app within the correct ecosystem.

**C. Effective Date**

Clearly display the date the policy was **last updated** and became effective.

---

### 2. Data Collection and Usage

This section must be transparent about what data is collected and why. A core principle of data privacy is **data minimization**, so developers should only collect what is necessary.

**A. Types of Data Collected**

- List every type of personal and non-personal data the app collects, such as:
  - Email addresses  
  - Avatars  
  - Bookmarks  
  - Notes  
  - Reading history  
- Clarify that public **Quran text and associated metadata** are retrieved via the API **without collecting personal user data** from the source.

**B. Purpose of Collection (Lawful Basis)**

- For each type of data collected, explain its **specific purpose** and which application features rely on it.  
- This fulfills the **“Lawful Basis for Processing”** requirement under regulations like GDPR.

**C. Prohibited Uses**

Include clear statements that:

- No user data is used to **build advertising profiles**.  
- QF user data will **not be sold, mined, or repurposed** for any function beyond the explicitly stated features.  
- **User-generated content**, such as “user reflections,” is **not used for training AI models** without obtaining **prior, specific user consent**.

**D. Handling of Sensitive Data (Religious Information)**

Because data relating to religious beliefs is often classified as **“special category” or “sensitive” data**:

- **Acknowledge Sensitive Data**  
  The policy must recognize that data related to a user’s religious beliefs is considered sensitive personal data under GDPR and other global privacy laws, and therefore receives stronger legal protection.
- **Require Explicit Consent**  
  Developers must obtain **explicit, affirmative consent** from a user before collecting or processing any religious data.  
  - This consent must be **separate** from general agreement to the terms of service.  
  - It must require a **clear, specific action** from the user (for example, checking an unticked box).

---

### 3. Data Sharing and Third Parties

Transparency about data sharing is critical for user trust and legal compliance.

**A. Sub-processor Disclosure**

- Identify all third-party services (**sub-processors**) that handle user data, such as:
  - Hosting providers  
  - Analytics services  
- Provide **direct links** to the privacy policies of each of these third parties.

**B. Data Protection Agreements**

- Affirm that **legally binding contracts** are in place with all third parties requiring them to **protect user data**.  
- The policy must state that third parties are required to **respect Islamic content guidelines** and are **prohibited from misusing Quran / Quranic text**.

---

### 4. Data Security

Developers must describe the measures in place to protect user data.

**A. Security Measures**

Specify the use of **industry-standard security practices**, including:

- TLS for data in transit  
- Encryption-at-rest  
- Access controls  
- A defined **secret rotation cadence**

**B. Incident Response**

- State the window for responding to a security incident, which must be **less than 24 hours**.

**C. Compliance Reference**

- The policy must reference **“Security Rule 6.9”** as required.

---

### 5. User Rights and Controls

The policy must empower users by clearly explaining their rights over their data.

**A. Data Control Mechanisms**

- Explain how users can **revoke the application’s access** via OAuth tokens and disable specific data permissions.  
- Provide a **direct link** to the **QF OAuth Revocation endpoint**.

**B. Data Deletion**

- Describe the process for data deletion.  
- Link to an in-app **“Delete My Data”** screen or equivalent mechanism.

**C. Other Data Rights**

- Inform users of their right to:
  - Access a copy of their data  
  - Correct inaccurate information  

---

### 6. Data Retention and Deletion

The policy must define how long data is stored.

**A. Retention Period**

- State that user data is retained for as long as the user’s **account is active**.

**B. Deletion Timeline**

- Commit that user data will be **hard-deleted within 30 days** of a request.  
- Clarify that data in backups will be **wiped within 90 days**.

**C. QF Account Deletion**

- Ensure the policy states that if a user **deletes their main QF account**, associated data within the app (like notes and bookmarks) is also **deleted**.

---

### 7. Children’s Privacy

This section must address legal requirements related to minors.

**A. Age Restrictions**

- Declare that the app is **not intended for children under the age of 13** (or under 18 if aligning with Google Gemini or similar terms).  
- State that the app will **block sign-ups** if it detects a user is underage.

**B. Parental Guidance (Optional)**

- For religious apps, developers may optionally include **guidance for parents** on supervising their children’s use of the app.

---

### 8. International Data Transfers

If the app is available globally, this section is required.

**A. Cross-Border Transfers**

- Clearly state if user data may be processed in a country **outside of the user’s home country**.

**B. Legal Safeguards**

Because the application may be accessible in various international regions, the policy must adopt a **high standard of data protection by default**. It must state that:

- For any international data transfer, the developer relies on legal mechanisms like the EU’s **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** or an equivalent data transfer framework to ensure data is protected in accordance with **GDPR standards**.

**C. Local Law Compliance**

- Affirm that the developer is responsible for complying with **all applicable data protection and transfer laws** specific to the countries or regions where their users are located.

---

### 9. Policy Updates and Contact Information

The policy must be a living document, and users must be informed of changes.

**A. Notification of Changes**

- Explain how users will be notified of **material changes** to the privacy policy, such as:
  - Via in-app banner  
  - Via email  
- Explain how the **effective date** is updated.

**B. Contact Details**

- Provide a valid **email** and **postal address** for privacy-related inquiries.  
- Guarantee a response to inquiries within **30 days**.
