# Quran Foundation Developer Terms of Service (“Terms”)

**Last updated:** 2025-06-13

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. By accessing or using the Quran Foundation (“QF”) application-programming interfaces, software development kits, webhooks, OAuth services, related documentation, and any associated services (collectively, **“APIs”**), you (“**Developer**,” “**you**”) agree to be bound by these Terms, the QF Developer Privacy-Policy Requirements, and all other guidelines published at the Developer Privacy Policy (insert updated DPP here – see email) (together, the **“Developer Policies”**).

If you use the APIs on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms, and “Developer” will refer to that organization.

## 2. License Grant

### 2.1 API license

Subject to full, continuous compliance with these Terms, QF grants Developer a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and use the APIs solely to develop and operate Applications that provide beneficial Quranic experiences to end users.

### 2.2 QF Content license

Developer may display QF Content to end users within the Application, provided that:

- The text of the Quran is **not modified in any way**.  
- QF Content is **not resold, sublicensed, or redistributed** except as integral to the end-user experience of the Application.  
- QF Content is **never used in a context that promotes hate, extremism, or misinformation**, nor combined with unlawful, sexual, or other inappropriate material. Any other form of commercial redistribution or use of QF Content or raw API data requires a separate written commercial license agreement with QF.  
- Any snippets of QF Content must be presented in a manner that preserves their original context and meaning, and you may **not arrange or display snippets in a way that alters or misrepresents** the intended message of the source material.

### 2.3 Reservation of rights

Except for the licenses expressly granted, QF retains all right, title, and interest in the APIs and QF Content.

## 3. Developer Obligations

### 3.1 Acceptable use

Developer must **NOT**:

1. Attempt to extract, scrape, or index QF Content or User Data outside the API responses.  
2. Exceed published rate limits or quotas nor attempt to circumvent technical restrictions.  
3. Cache or store QF Content longer than **1 week** unless expressly permitted.  
4. Use QF Content or User Data to build advertising profiles, biometric identifiers, or machine-learning models without written consent.  
5. Display or transmit content that is disparaging to Islam, promotes extremist ideology, or misrepresents the Qurʾān.  
6. Subvert or disable any security, authentication, or access-control mechanism.  
7. Mislead users about the source, features, or functionality of the Application or APIs.

### 3.2 Security & privacy

Developer must:

- Implement industry-standard security (e.g., **TLS 1.2+**, encryption at rest, least-privilege access, secret rotation).  
- Process User Data only for the feature(s) disclosed to and authorised by the user, in line with the **Developer Privacy-Policy Requirements**.  
- Provide a publicly reachable **Privacy Policy** and **Terms of Use** for the Application. This Privacy Policy must, at a minimum, incorporate all principles and requirements set forth in the QF Developer Privacy Policy Requirements, available at \[insert link to guidelines].  
- Promptly (within **24 hours**) report to **security@quran.com** any actual or suspected unauthorised access, security breach, or data exposure related to the APIs.

### 3.3 OAuth and scopes

Developer must:

- Request only the **minimum scopes necessary** for each feature and support incremental authorization.  
- Provide users a **clear method** to revoke tokens and delete their data.

### 3.4 Audit & monitoring

QF may **monitor API activity** to verify compliance. Developer shall **not interfere** with such monitoring.

## 4. Updates, Deprecation & Migration

QF may modify or discontinue any API, feature, or endpoint. QF will provide commercially reasonable advance notice (typically **30 days**) via the Developer Portal or email when a breaking change or deprecation is scheduled. After the deprecation period, calls may fail. Developer is responsible for **timely migration**.

---

## 5. Suspension & Revocation

QF may suspend or revoke Developer’s API credentials, **immediately and without liability**, if:

- Developer breaches these Terms or the Developer Policies; or  
- QF reasonably believes suspension is necessary to protect its systems, Users, or the integrity of the Qurʾān; or  
- Required by law.

---

## 6. Term & Termination

These Terms commence when Developer first accesses the APIs and continue until terminated.

**By Developer.**  
Developer may terminate by ceasing all API use and deleting all QF Content and User Data (unless retention is legally required).

**By QF.**  
QF may terminate these Terms upon **30 days’ notice** or immediately for breach.

**Effect of termination.**  
Upon termination, all licenses automatically terminate, and Developer must promptly delete QF Content and User Data in its possession, provided that Developer may provide a mechanism for users to export their own User Data prior to deletion.

---

## 7. Confidentiality

Any non-public information disclosed by QF (including access tokens, rate-limit values, or unpublished documentation) is QF **Confidential Information**. Developer must protect it with reasonable care and use it only to exercise rights under these Terms.

---

## 8. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability
